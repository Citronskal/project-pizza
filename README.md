# Project Name

I tried to recreate the provided Pizzaria example with Javascript. I used switch and if else method to make most of the commands. I was a bit too focus on recreating the exact result, so I didn't have a creative work in the end. But overall, I got to practice the basic javascript methods and that was really helpful.

## The problem

I encountered quite a lot of problems. After the first prompt, I had to try many times to get the switch and if else right. Especially I was having a hard time understanding "parseInt" and how could I make my prompt look EXACTLY the same as the example.
If I have more time, I will definitely spend less time on making my project looks exactly the same but try more different method and have fun with using javascript.
